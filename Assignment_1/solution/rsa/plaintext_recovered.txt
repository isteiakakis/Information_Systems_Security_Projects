Hello world! Hi people. Hi everybody.

I am just a plaintext. A plain plaintext.
A plaintext that is going to be encrypted.

Through RSA.

And then decrypted.

I am keeping my fingers crossed that after
that I will be the same!




Test me (from bash) using:

printf "193939\n199933\n" | ./rsa_assign_1 -g
./rsa_assign_1 -i plaintext.txt -o ciphertext.txt -k public.key -e
./rsa_assign_1 -i ciphertext.txt -o plaintext_recovered.txt -k private.key -d


You can change the prime numbers if you want, here are some choices:
